# Personal_Portfolio
A small portfolio of my work done during a stage 4 python bootcamp.

This will be a collection of my personal coding experiences that are noted to show personal
growth as well as the proof of my continued improvement using Python and associated programs
and coding languages.

All permissions to view are accepted, however please Email me with any ammendments or corrections
so that I may see where I can improve or correct myself :) Many Thanks
